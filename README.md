# DOIO-Project-Management
A weekend project written in PHP

DOIO is a simple project management tool made in one weekend. There is still a lot of work to do to make it totally usable. At the moment some of the main features implemented are:

1. Organization registration
2. Team members invitation
3. Project creation
4. Task's board
5. Task creation
6. Task commenting
7. User profile editing

## Why did I do it?
I was bored. :)
